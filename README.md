I have done this project under my internship/training program at Tata Steel LTD. where I took the data from it's superstore vendor to find out the sales and profit of the store.
I have used Tableau to perform this analysis.

This is the given dashboard that I have created in the project work. The details of the graphs in the dashboard are as follows - 
1. Time Series Analysis = This chart displays monthly sales and profit data over two years and helps in identifying trends and patterns in sales and profitability over time, making easy to compare month-on-month performance.
2. Profit Margin Analysis = This graph shows the profit margin percentages over the same two-year period, offering insights into the profitability efficiency per month.
3. Geographic Distribution = I have done a geographic map which pinpoints sales and profits by city across India and each point's size and color intensity vary based on the sales volume and profit margins, providing a visual representation of regional performance.
4. Product Category Analysis = A breakdown of sales and profits by product sub-categories which allows for quick identification of which categories are performing well or underperforming.
5. Category and Regional Breakdown = Shows sales and profits for different product sub-categories, enabling stakeholders to focus on specific areas of interest within product lines.

This dashboard effectively combines various data visualization techniques to provide a holistic view of the company's sales and financial health, enabling stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions based on comprehensive and multi-dimensional data insights.
