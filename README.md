I have done this project as my Tata Steel Internship/Training Program. I have taken the dataset from the superstore of Tata Steel's vendor for the sales analysis. I took a major initiative to transform raw sales data of the superstore and convert it to actionable insights by adeptly utilizing Tableau to create dynamic visualizations and comprehensive dashboards. It involved rigorous analysis of sales and profit trends to enhance strategic decision-making processes across various departments. 
I have contributed significantly to the optimization of product strategies and regional sales tactics by identifying key performance metrics and trends.
